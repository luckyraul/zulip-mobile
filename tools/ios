# These two steps "build" and "upload" are logically part of a single
# sequence: when all goes well, we invariably follow each "build" with
# one "upload".  (As described in docs/howto/release.md .)
#
# They're separate because sometimes things do not go well, and in
# particular sometimes "upload" fails for transient reasons.  And the
# "build" step is slow, so when retrying and/or debugging the upload,
# it's very helpful to reuse the build output.
